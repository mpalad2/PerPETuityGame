# PerPETuityGame
Partner Project for Game Development - a pixel 2DUnity game

This is a part of a partner project created for game development in Fall 2020
We created characters, assets, and animations for a small pixel game and programmed them to move and fight.
This does not contain the full game, as the files are too large, but it does include the scripts for the game!
The game can be played here: https://spubbyborp.itch.io/perpetuity-true-bonds .
